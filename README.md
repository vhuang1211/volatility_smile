# Volatility Smile: Evidence from the TAIEX Options Market
[NCCU Fall 2021] Option Valuation and Application Course Project

This project examines the volatility smile phenomenon in the Taiwan index options market. Using data from the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) and Python, implied volatility is calculated via the Black-Scholes model. The results confirm that implied volatility decreases as the strike price increases, providing clear evidence of a volatility smile in the market.
